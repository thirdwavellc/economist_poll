"Allen, Franklin",Uncertain,5,Difficult to answer such a general question - more information about the particular circumstances is required.
"Antras, Pol",Uncertain,7,"There is evidence of positive effects of attracting firms (esp. via backward linkages), but hard to compare estimated gains to tax breaks"
"Baldwin, Richard",Disagree,5,
"Bénassy-Quéré, Agnès",Disagree,8,Even in distressed areas this kind of policy gets poor results.
"Besley, Timothy J.",Uncertain,8,It rides on whether the tax incentives are targeted towards industries with high spillovers.  
"Blanchard, Olivier",Uncertain,9,"it depends on the demand elasticity. There are cases where it is greater than one, but cases where it is less.  ``typically'' is too strong"
"Bloom, Nicholas",Disagree,6,Providing incentives to firms is highly risky in terms of corruption and distortions of government incentives.
"Blundell, Richard William",Disagree,8,"Apart from encouraging some initial start-ups in a field, firm specific subsidies very likely distort production and reduce overall income. "
"Carletti, Elena",Agree,7,this seems to be proved by countries like Ireland or Luxembourg where fiscal advantages to firms seem to be beneficial 
"Danthine, Jean-Pierre",Agree,6,It is a matter of self-interest for the region itself but there may be circumstances where the region's interests are not well represented.

"Krahnen, Jan Pieter",Agree,7,"While benefits are consummated locally, negative externalities and allocative distortions are largely outside the country. "
