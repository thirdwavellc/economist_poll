"Aghion, Philippe",Did Not Answer,,
"Allen, Franklin",Uncertain,3,I am not knowledgeable about the evidence in this area.  Setting quotas is a good idea in my view but not because of value increase.
"Antras, Pol",Uncertain,8,The answer would surely depend on what the quota is set to! I think a quota is reasonable but empirical evidence  / for externalities is scant
"Bénassy-Quéré, Agnès",No Opinion,,I think there are already quotas in a number of countries.

"Blanchard, Olivier",Agree,3,Different perspectives are typically useful.  Whether there is a sufficiently large pool of qualified women today is not obvious.

"Krahnen, Jan Pieter",Disagree,5,"Even if more women on boards meant better decisions, the effect on shareholder value in general equilibrium is likely non-positive."
"Krusell, Per",Agree,3,Initially the reaction may be the opposite but my belief is that over the longer run it would be a plus. No data to back it up though!
"La Ferrara, Eliana",Uncertain,3,
"Leuz, Christian",Uncertain,5,"In short run, evidence suggests negative effects likely bc supply of qualified women is not yet large enough. Not much evidence on long-run."
