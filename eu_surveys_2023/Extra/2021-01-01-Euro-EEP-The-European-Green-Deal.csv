"Allen, Franklin",Disagree,6,There are a lot of opportunities building new businesses from the climate change initiative. The time horizon is long enough for it to be ok,,Uncertain,3,This is an interesting question. I do not know the research in this area well.,
"Antras, Pol",Uncertain,4,"It's certainly would be costly, but I don't know what is meant by ""major drag on economic growth""",,Agree,8,The late Marty Weitzman taught us that the theoretical answer is ambiguous; but taxes are more transparent and less prone to rent-seeking,
"Bénassy-Quéré, Agnès",Uncertain,5,Depends on how the policy is carried out. The overall drag on growth may be limited but large uncertainty. Counterfactual is also unclear.,,Agree,5,In theory cap-and-trade is attractive but in practice it fails to give a long-term perspective on carbon prices.,
"Blanchard, Olivier",Uncertain,7,"Carbon taxes or caps are likely to lead to stranded assets, but alsohigh investment in new technologies. May come with higher tfp as well.  ",,Uncertain,7,"Weitzman discussion of prices versus quantities.  Cap and trade more manipulable, but achieving given quantity for sure may be needed.  ",
"Bloom, Nicholas",Disagree,5,,,Uncertain,1,,
"Blundell, Richard William",Uncertain,4,,,Agree,6,,
"Carletti, Elena",Uncertain,3,,,Uncertain,2,,
"Danthine, Jean-Pierre",Disagree,3,A well crafted and timed transition strategy will create significant economic opportunities. ,,Agree,3,I tend to agree but reaching the goal while taking political constraints into account requires being pragmatic,
"De Grauwe, Paul",Disagree,7,"Creative destruction is involved here. It is never a major drag on growth, but leads losers and winners",,Agree,7,In absence of uncertainty both are equivalent. Cap and trade creates too much cost uncertainty for the investors in new technologies,
"Eeckhout, Jan",Uncertain,5,,,Uncertain,7,"This about the uncertainty of the economic consequences. The carbon tax allows quantity to adjust, C&T lets price adjust. We don't know...",
"Fehr, Ernst",Disagree,7,,,Agree,8,,
"Freixas, Xavier",Uncertain,5,"The need for new technologies may substitute for the direct cost. Still, it may be the case that other countries get the benefits",,Strongly Agree,9,prices are better than caps at producing the right effects,
"Fuchs-Schündeln, Nicola",Disagree,5,,,Uncertain,5,,
"Galí, Jordi",Uncertain,7,,,Agree,5,,
"Giavazzi, Francesco",Disagree,8,,,Uncertain,6,,
"Griffith, Rachel",Uncertain,1,,,Uncertain,1,,
"Guerrieri, Veronica",Uncertain,3,,,Uncertain,3,,
"Guiso, Luigi",Disagree,6,,,Uncertain,5,,
"Honohan, Patrick",Disagree,1,"Admittedly it could be if handled badly; among other things, depends heavily on rest of world�s policies.",,Agree,1,On balance this seems a cleaner approach less likely to be hijacked by special interest lobbying.,
"Javorcik, Beata",Disagree,4,,,Agree,6,,
"Kőszegi, Botond",Disagree,4,,,Uncertain,10,,
"Krahnen, Jan Pieter",Disagree,5,"The policy will require significant public and private investments, allowing for knock-on effects that are likely to spur growth.",,Disagree,5,"The big difference is the ""cap"" - without it, taxes may distort investment and consumption, but will not necessarily reduce emissions. ",
"La Ferrara, Eliana",Disagree,2,,,Disagree,3,"Cap-and-trade allows to better control total amount of emissions. Also, in Europe carbon taxes pose greater political economy problems",
"Leuz, Christian",Uncertain,2,Likely a drag but hard to know how large. Goals have consequences for competitiveness & require large investments.,,Agree,3,"Tax has some advantages (link), but no clear dominance. Cap&trade may be politically easier to implement. Either one better than status quo.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2010007813500103
"Mayer, Thierry",Disagree,6,,,Uncertain,3,,
"Meghir, Costas",Uncertain,5,"Zero emissions can be achieved in many ways - innovation, change in structure of tax without increases, are neutral or enhance growth.",,Agree,7,,
"Neary, Peter",Uncertain,4,Growth may be lower; but could be lower still if environmental degradation proceeds unchecked. Markets undevalue environmental quality,,Uncertain,5,"Both are good alternatives to command-and-control, incentivizing concern for environmental quality. The choice between them is contingent",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2296698
"O'Rourke, Kevin",Strongly Disagree,7,,,Uncertain,5,,
"Pagano, Marco",Uncertain,1,,,Uncertain,1,,
"Pastor, Lubos",Disagree,3,It will be a drag on brown growth but a boost for green growth.,,Uncertain,3,,
"Persson, Torsten",Disagree,4,,,Agree,5,,
"Pissarides, Christopher",Disagree,7,Switching to lower or zero emissions will create jobs that will offset any negative effects on GDP ,,Agree,8,Both are needed. If I had to choose one only I would choose taxes,
"Portes, Richard",Uncertain,5,,,Strongly Agree,5,,
"Prendergast, Canice",Uncertain,9,,,Agree,8,,
"Reichlin, Lucrezia",Disagree,6,,,Agree,5,,
"Repullo, Rafael",Disagree,4,,,Agree,6,,
"Rey, Hélène",Uncertain,8,"This all depends how we get there. If major EU coordinated investments, R&D and leadership role, costs will be mitigated",,Agree,9,Best way is predictably rising carbon price path with redistribution of carbon dividend and accompanying investments,
"Schoar, Antoinette",Uncertain,8,,,Disagree,7,Either can be effective depending on the enforcement environment and industry structure within a country.,
"Sturm, Daniel",Disagree,6,,,Agree,8,,
"Van Reenen, John",Disagree,7,My 2016 JPE paper with Aghion et al showed how carbon taxes (and R&D policies) could direct technical change towards cleaner innovation,http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1178.pdf,Agree,6,,
"Vickers, John",Uncertain,4,,,Agree,6,,
"Voth, Hans-Joachim",Agree,5,,,Strongly Disagree,6,,

"Whelan, Karl",Did Not Answer,,,,Did Not Answer,,,
"Wyplosz, Charles",Agree,7,"It will a drag, but major? We don't yet know what policies will be chosen so we can't guess about their impact.",,Strongly Agree,8,Carbon tax does the right thing (if set on a correct rising schedule) and brings money. Cap and trade can be manipulated. ,
"Zilibotti, Fabrizio",Disagree,9,,,Agree,9,,
