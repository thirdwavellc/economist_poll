Allen,Franklin,Agree,6,It's not clear to me how much impact central bank decisions have on environmental questions but to the extent it does they should do.,,Uncertain,5,It's a complex question with political as well as economic aspects. Having employment as an important secondary target may be better.,
Antras,Pol,Disagree,7,Seems like there should be other entities that can more directly take charge of environmental regulation.,,Uncertain,5,,
Blanchard,Olivier,Uncertain,8,``take into account'' is again ambiguous.  It should know about it but its standard mandate has  priority.  ,,Strongly Agree,9,"minimizing the output gap is more important than minimizing distance of inflation to target.   Fortunately, they largely coincide. ",
Bloom,Nicholas,Disagree,10,"Monetary policy should focus on macro issues - inflation, unemployment etc - not social and environmental issues. ",,Uncertain,10,,

Fuchs-Schündeln,Nicola,Agree,7,,,Agree,8,,
Galí,Jordi,Agree,8,But will likely conclude that those implications are small. The ECB cannot be a substitute for fiscal and regulatory policies in that area.,,Agree,8,"Even though the current emphasis on the inflation objective as a ""medium term"" objective already allows for that.",

Krahnen,Jan Pieter,Strongly Disagree,7,"Recall Tinbergen: one policy instrument per objective. Keep monetary policy for inflation targeting, use Ordnungspolitik otherwise.   ",,Strongly Disagree,6,"Treaty is wise and respects Tinbergen rule. If you want more employment, use fiscal measures or, again, a better Ordnungspolitik. ",
La Ferrara,Eliana,Did Not Answer,,,,Did Not Answer,,,
Leuz,Christian,Uncertain,2,Clear that via effect on econ activity ECB policy has env implications but not obvious if mon policy is best way to address externalities,,Disagree,2,"While I can see arguments for Fed or BoE, it would be much harder for ECB w/ so many euro ctrys, emply better addressed with fiscal policies",

Pagano,Marco,Agree,5,"I guess that the ECB could/should take environmental concerns into account in its bank prudential policy, not its monetary policy.",,Strongly Agree,7,"In this sense, its statutory mandate should be made more similar to that of the Fed. In practice it already pursued this objective too.",

Pissarides,Christopher,Strongly Agree,10,"A no brainer. Need to save the planet, everyone should take into account the environmental implications of their decisions even the mighty ",,Agree,10,employment should be taken into account but maybe not as much weight on it as price stability,
Portes,Richard,Disagree,8,,,Strongly Agree,9,,
Prendergast,Canice,Agree,8,,,Uncertain,8,,
Rasul,Imran,Disagree,5,,,Agree,5,,
Reichlin,Lucrezia,Agree,9,,,Disagree,9,Flex IT and commitment to nominal GDP targeting path best way to minimise output vol in short run and achieve price stability in medium run,
Repullo,Rafael,Disagree,8,As Jean Tirole recommended in his speech at the colloquium in honor of Benoit Coeure: “Use the proper instrument.” ,,No Opinion,,An irrelevant hypothetical question: The Treaty is not going to be changed anytime soon. ,
Rey,Hélène,Agree,9,For example the ECB should lead on TCFD disclosure,,Disagree,9,ECB has a legal obligation to support the [EU’s] general economic policies; objectives laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty.so more general,
Schoar,Antoinette,Uncertain,9,"ECB does not have effective tools to achieve environmental goals. Policy makers, consumers and voters need to take responsibility for this.",,Disagree,10,central banks do not have tools to achieve long run employment goals. ,
Sturm,Daniel,Agree,6,Quantitative easing could avoid buying fossil fuel related bonds.,,Uncertain,3,,
Van Reenen,John,Disagree,7,Bad idea to load too many targets on one instrument,,Disagree,6,,
Vickers,John,Disagree,7,Environmental objectives call for policy tools other than monetary policy,,Disagree,9,"Monetary policy can best contribute to maximum sustainable employment by maintaining price stability, so that should be primary",
Voth,Hans-Joachim,Disagree,9,,,Disagree,7,,
Whelan,Karl,Strongly Agree,10,"While price stability is ECB's primary objective, it is required by Treaty to support the EU's broader goals, including evironmental policy.",,Uncertain,5,Tricky one. I'm not sure ECB and the Fed really behave much differently despite different mandates. Treaty Change is impossible anyway.,
Wyplosz,Charles,Strongly Disagree,8,"As Tinbergen said, one instrument = one target. Bringing inflation up to the target would already be a big achievement.",,Uncertain,9,"Yeah, sure, it sounds nice. But we don't know how to measure maximum sustainable unemployment. And unemployment is not just a macro variable",
