"Allen, Franklin",Uncertain,3,This is an interesting question. I do not know the research in this area well.
"Antras, Pol",Agree,8,The late Marty Weitzman taught us that the theoretical answer is ambiguous; but taxes are more transparent and less prone to rent-seeking
"Bénassy-Quéré, Agnès",Agree,5,In theory cap-and-trade is attractive but in practice it fails to give a long-term perspective on carbon prices.
"Blanchard, Olivier",Uncertain,7,"Weitzman discussion of prices versus quantities.  Cap and trade more manipulable, but achieving given quantity for sure may be needed.  "
"Bloom, Nicholas",Uncertain,1,
"Blundell, Richard William",Agree,6,
"Carletti, Elena",Uncertain,2,
"Danthine, Jean-Pierre",Agree,3,I tend to agree but reaching the goal while taking political constraints into account requires being pragmatic
"De Grauwe, Paul",Agree,7,In absence of uncertainty both are equivalent. Cap and trade creates too much cost uncertainty for the investors in new technologies
"Eeckhout, Jan",Uncertain,7,"This about the uncertainty of the economic consequences. The carbon tax allows quantity to adjust, C&T lets price adjust. We don't know..."
"Fehr, Ernst",Agree,8,
"Freixas, Xavier",Strongly Agree,9,prices are better than caps at producing the right effects

"Javorcik, Beata",Agree,6,
"Kőszegi, Botond",Uncertain,10,
"Krahnen, Jan Pieter",Disagree,5,"The big difference is the ""cap"" - without it, taxes may distort investment and consumption, but will not necessarily reduce emissions. "
"La Ferrara, Eliana",Disagree,3,"Cap-and-trade allows to better control total amount of emissions. Also, in Europe carbon taxes pose greater political economy problems"
"Leuz, Christian",Agree,3,"Tax has some advantages (link), but no clear dominance. Cap&trade may be politically easier to implement. Either one better than status quo."
"Mayer, Thierry",Uncertain,3,
"Meghir, Costas",Agree,7,
"Neary, Peter",Uncertain,5,"Both are good alternatives to command-and-control, incentivizing concern for environmental quality. The choice between them is contingent"

"Pagano, Marco",Uncertain,1,

"Reichlin, Lucrezia",Agree,5,
"Repullo, Rafael",Agree,6,
"Rey, Hélène",Agree,9,Best way is predictably rising carbon price path with redistribution of carbon dividend and accompanying investments
"Schoar, Antoinette",Disagree,7,Either can be effective depending on the enforcement environment and industry structure within a country.
"Sturm, Daniel",Agree,8,

"Wyplosz, Charles",Strongly Agree,8,Carbon tax does the right thing (if set on a correct rising schedule) and brings money. Cap and trade can be manipulated.
